How do I save the information I've entered for my plan? The page you see after clicking Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans , and then New Site collects basic information about your project in order to estimate review fees and permitting requirements. Filling this page out by itself is not a plan submission. After filling this page out, you will be taken to a page that will summarize your permitting requirements and provide instructions for creating or requesting access to your project address so you can begin entering the plan. See Questions 26 and 26 for more information on how to request and share site access. 4. Where do I go to upload my plan set/drawings/other documents? To upload documents to an existing plan: Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your SGS homepage. Click Sites and Plans . Click on the eye icon to open the plan. On the plan page, there will be a section called Plan Documents. Click the button called Add Document . Select the document type from the Type of Document dropdown. If you are uploading a fee payment receipt, make sure to mark it as Fee Invoices or Receipts . If a plan has not been entered yet, please see Question 2. This applies for raze permits as well. 5. I'm trying to upload my plan set documents to my plan; why isn't it working? Depending on your internet connection and the file size, the upload may time out and give you an error. Typically, files over 100 MB will result in this error. If you receive this error, separate your file into smaller parts and upload them as \"1 of 3,\" \"2 of 3\" etc. For plan sets, include the cover page as the first page of each part. If a plan has not been entered yet, please see Question 2. This applies for raze permits as well. 6. I'm trying to begin entering my project into the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS); why can't I see the site in my list of sites? If you don't see the site in your list, then you need to either create it or get access to it. Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain Click Sites and Plans Click New Site Enter in the site address and click Populate data from address Fill out some of your project information Click Save & close If DOEE already has records identifying a site owner or manager at your address, this person will need to authorize you to act as their agent. You will see a button that says Request access to this site . Click this button to request to be an agent of the site owner. You can also follow the instructions in Question 26 to make this request. This step needs to be completed before you will be able to access the site. If there is no site owner currently listed, clicking Request access to this site will automatically give you access to the site. If you do not see the Request access to this site button, then you can continue to create the site. 7. I'm trying to access a site record to upload my Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) plan, but I can't get access to the site record. How do I get access? If there's no site owner listed and there are only ESC plans at the site, see Question 6. If you are still unable to get access to the site, email sgs.help@dc.gov to request access. If there is a site owner listed for the site or the site has Stormwater Management Plans associated with it, see Question 26. 8. Who should be listed as the site owner? The site owner should be the person who has long-term management and maintenance responsibility for the site once the project completes construction. This is the person DOEE will contact years after project completion about maintenance inspections or if there is any issue with maintenance. An engineer, architect, general contractor, or construction manager should not list themself as the site owner unless they are responsible for managing the project after completion. If they list themselves as the site owner, DOEE will require that the correct person be listed. If the site is going to be sold soon after construction completion, the current site owner still needs to be listed. The current site owner is required to sign the maintenance responsibility statement, declaration of covenant, and other documents during the plan submittal process. 9. I'm an engineer entering a Stormwater Management Plan. How do I get my client listed as the site owner? When you submit a request to create an agent relationship, the site owner receives a request to approve the agent relationship and to confirm site ownership. Once site ownership is confirmed, the site owner will be recorded in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). For the steps to create an agent relationship, see Question 26. DOEE recommends not waiting until the last minute to get the site owner listed. Stormwater Management Plans cannot be submitted, for the first time or for a resubmission, without having the site owner listed. 10. I'm entering an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan. What should I enter in the land cover section? For ESC only plans, the land cover types and square footages should be entered in the section called Land Cover . There are three types: natural (forest or meadow); compacted (grass and landscaped areas); and impervious (driveways, roofs, patios, etc). Do not just enter the total square footage of your project as natural; you'll need to enter the correct values into each section. The total pre project area and total post project area need to be equal before you will be able to save your changes. Do not include any building renovation square footage in the Impervious field. Enter that in the Building footprint field in the Project Description section. 11. How do I edit my Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) plan? To edit an ESC plan, the plan needs to have already been created in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) and you need to have access to the plan in the SGS: If the plan hasn't been created yet, see Question 2. If you do not have access to the plan in the SGS, see Question 6. If your ESC plan has been approved, see Question 19. If you have access to the plan and the plan has not been approved yet, you can edit the plan: Log in to the SGS. Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain. Click Sites and Plans . In the All Plans section, click the eye icon next to your plan. Once the next page loads, click the Edit button at the top of the page next to the Refresh button. 12. Why am I getting a Major Substantial Improvement/Major Land Disturbing error when I try to submit? I'm entering an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan. Check your land cover values that are in the plan. In the Land Cover section you should only enter the number of square feet that are being disturbed, not the total lot area. If you've entered a square footage value into the Building footprint field in the Project Description section, do not also add that value in the Impervious field in the Land Cover section. The system will double count the value and increase the total area of your project. If this crosses a certain threshold, the system will flag the plan as needing a Stormwater Management Plan. If you're doing utility work, make sure you fill in the field Portion of land disturbance that is solely utility work (square feet) in the Land Cover section. 13. Where do I find the EIF form? You can find the EIF form [here]. It needs to be signed and uploaded to the SGS. 14. How do I check on my plan status? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans . On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number to open the plan. Scroll down to the Plan Review section. The bottom-most line will show the most recent plan status. 15. I submitted my Erosion and Sediment Control plan more than 30 business days ago and still have not received any comments. When will I hear back? Make sure your project has been submitted to DCRA through ProjectDox. DOEE review only begins after this has been completed. If you have questions relating to your ProjectDox status, please reach out to Nykia Barnes at nykia.barnes@dc.gov or Saba Gharavi at saba.gharavi@dc.gov . 16. Who should sign the Maintenance Responsibility and Off-Site Retention Volume Statements for Stormwater Management Plans? The maintenance responsibility statement and the Off-Site Retention Volume statement (if applicable) should be signed by the person listed as \\\"site owner or manager\\\" for the site in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). In most cases this should be the property owner, although it is acceptable to list a long-term property manager. The person who signs these statements becomes legally responsible for ensuring maintenance and off-site retention volume compliance once the project completes construction. These statements cannot be signed by the engineer, architect, construction manager, contractor, or landscaping company that has been hired to perform maintenance. 17. How do I sign the Maintenance Responsibility Statement for my Stormwater Management Plan? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans . On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number to open the plan. Scroll down to the BMPs section and click the button Sign Maintenance Responsibility Stamp . Fill out the next page and Save . 18. How do I sign the Offv Statement for my Stormwater Management Plan? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans . On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number to open the plan. Scroll down to the Summary, Offv, and SRCs section and click the button Sign Offv Statement . Fill out the next page and Save . 19. How do I edit an approved plan? The plan reviewer needs to return the plan before you will be able to edit it. 20. Why can't I edit my best management practice (BMP)? Once your project begins construction and DOEE has inspected your BMP, it will be locked from editing in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Please email your BMP changes to your plan reviewer so they can update it on your behalf in the SGS. For each BMP that needs to be edited, specify each value that needs to be updated (including pre- and post-project land cover values, storage volume, etc.), and also specify the existing values. Please note that any Site Drainage Areas can still be edited without DOEE's assistance. If any BMP type has changed, for example a bioretention was changed to a tree planting, DOEE will remove the old BMP but you will need to enter in the new BMP. DOEE must be notified of this change for it to occur. 21. How do I upload my as-built? The final inspection must have occurred, and the inspector needs to have entered it into your plan. Your plan must also be approved. To upload the as-built, log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) and click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then click Sites and Plans . In the All Plans section, click the eye icon next to your plan to open it. Scroll down to the Plan Documents section and click the button Submit As-built . You cannot use the Add Document button. When attaching your as-built, make sure you select \"as-built\" as the type of document. Errors 22. I'm trying to create a new site, but I'm getting an error. What do I do? You'll need to fix the error before you can move on and enter the plan. The most common error is shown below. This error means that we already have a record of that site in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) and you're trying to enter a duplicate site. If this is for a Stormwater Management Plan, you'll need to send an agent request to the site owner (see Question 26 for more information). If this is for Erosion and Sediment Control only, email sgs.help@dc.gov . If you're receiving a different error, see Question 23. 23. I'm getting an error that says \"Access Needed\" or \"Ticket Expired.\" What do I do? First, clear your cache. If that doesn't work, open the SGS in an incognito window in Chrome. If none of the above work, submit a help ticket using the link Need help? Click here for assistance on the log in screen at doee.dc.gov/sgs . Getting and Sharing Access to a Site/Plan 24. Can I share a Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) account with my employees, co-workers, clients or a project team? No, each person using the SGS must have an account registered under their own name, and can only use that account to access the SGS. This is because the SGS is used to electronically sign legally binding agreements. If you share your account with others or use an account registered in someone else's name DOEE may disable that account or take further action. 25. Multiple people need to view or work on a project that I've entered into the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). How can I give them access? DOEE policy requires each person accessing the SGS to do so using an account registered in their own name. However, most projects require multiple people to be able to access the plans. There are two ways to grant shared access to a plan. For people in different organizations, such as the site owner and engineers working on the project, an agent relationship can be created. The site owner determines the amount of access for each agent. To create this relationship, see Question 26. For people within the same organization, the person managing an organization account can add staff. These staff will have access to everything that the organization account manager has access to. To add staff, see Question 27. 26. How do I create an agent relationship? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System(SGS) and click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your homepage, then click Agents and Staff . If you are anyone other than the site owner, click I am an agent for someone and enter in the site owner's information and click Submit . Once the site owner confirms, the agent relationship has been made. If you are the site owner, click Add an agent and enter in their information and click Submit . Once the agent confirms, the agent relationship has been made. The site owner can grant different levels of access and permission, including to all the sites they own or just to specific ones. These permissions can include Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) tasks as well. An agent can also grant access and permission to a subagent. The subagent relationship is specific to one site, so you must create a new relationship for each site. 27. How do I give staff on my team access to plan or site information? If you haven't already, you'll first need to identify a team member who will manage an organization account on behalf of your organization. If you already have an account that you'd like to make an organization account, please email Brandon Hunt at brandon.hunt@dc.gov . Otherwise, create an account and select Yes in the dropdown under Create an Organization Account . Once this is set up, the organization account manager can add staff by logging in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). On the SGS homepage, click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your homepage, then Agents and Staff and then Add my organization's staff . Fill out the subsequent page. Each user added as a staff member will have access to every site listed under the organization account. Certified Landscape Expert Process 28. I'm a site owner/engineer for the plan and I need to add/update certified landscape expert (CLE) information on an existing plan. How do I make the change? Under the CLE Information section of the plan, click the Add/edit CLE information button. You should then be able to add/edit the CLE information. 29. I am a Certified Landscape Expert (CLE) and I got the email to sign the Green Area Ratio (GAR) checklist. What steps do I need to take to sign a GAR document? Please read these instructions in their entirety before completing the GAR checklist Before the CLE can sign the GAR Checklist statements, they must create a Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) account if they do not have one already. Go to doee.dc.gov/sgs to create an account. The email entered in the CLE information section of the plan must match the email associated with the CLE's account in order for you to access the project. Creating an account does not automatically grant the CLE access to projects in the SGS (see Step 2). Before signing the checklist statement, the CLE must make sure that your contact information and GAR required licensing credentials are entered in the SGS plan under the CLE Information section. If the CLE information is not shown in the GAR checklist or if it shows the wrong information, click the Update CLE information link in the email and enter the correct information. You cannot update the checklist itself. The information is automatically populated from the plan page in the SGS. a. During plan entry, the project owner or their agent enters the CLE information by clicking the Add/edit CLE information button on the plan form. If the construction CLE is unknown at the time, then the design CLE's information will automatically populate the construction section. An SGS error will appear preventing plan approval if the credentials are not provided. b. If the project was approved prior to May 5, 2020, the CLE's credential information must be entered in the SGS before signing the GAR checklist. On the project page, click the Add/edit CLE information button to add the required information before signing the GAR Checklist. When DOEE's inspector completes the final GAR inspection, the CLE will receive an email requesting their signature on the landscape checklist. The CLE will click the link in the email and enter their login credentials. On the page that opens, click the Edit button at the top of the page, then complete all required questions on the landscape checklist. The SGS will automatically fill the credential information into the GAR Checklist. When the form is saved, the CLE's electronic signature will be applied. Once the CLE saves the form, the DOEE inspector can sign the landscape checklist. After this is done the CLE will receive a completed copy of the GAR Landscape Checklist via email. Fees 30. When will my Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) plan get assigned to a reviewer and/or have fees generated? DOEE fees for ESC plans are generated at the end of the review process. If you have not already initiated a permit application at DCRA, please contact Julienne Bautista at julienne.bautista@dc.gov to assign the project to a reviewer. Public-right-of-way ESC projects still need to apply for a DCRA permit. 31. How do I pay my fees? How to pay your fees online When a fee is assessed, the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) will send an email notification to the person identified as the site owner and the person who submitted the plan. This notification will include a link that you can use to view any fees associated with that plan and pay them through the online payment platform. This platform accepts both Visa and MasterCard. The system may time out after 1 minute. You can also look up fees for any plan using the DOEE plan number or fee ID number (available in the fee invoice). To do this, go to doee.dc.gov/sgs and click on the blue Pay Fees button on the login page (if you are not logged in or do not have an SGS account) or on your SGS home page (if you are logged into your account). Enter either the DOEE plan number or fee ID and click Display Report . If the fee still needs to be paid, there will be a blue button called Pay Fee. Click it to begin the payment process. Note that you do not need to log into your SGS account to pay the fees, but you will need to log into view fee assessment details or download a PDF invoice. To download a PDF invoice, see Question 32. You can find these instructions online, along with more fee information, here . How to pay your fees in person You can also pay fees in person at 1101 4 th Street SW Washington, DC 20024. You will need two copies of the invoice and a copy of the SOAR revenue/receipts for each requirement your plan has: SWMP, ESC, and/or GAR. For example, an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan will need two copies of the invoice and one copy of the SOAR receipt for their ESC fees. A Stormwater Management and ESC plan will need two copies of the invoice and one SOAR receipt for the Stormwater Management fees, and two copies of the invoice and one SOAR receipt for the ESC fees, etc. If you don't have these documents with you, you won't be able to pay the fee. See Question 32 for how to access your fee invoice. Once your fee has been paid, log into the SGS and upload a copy of the receipt to the plan. See Question 4 for more information. You can find these instructions online, along with more fee information, [here][33]. 32. How do I find the invoice and SOAR receipt for a fee? You will need access to the plan in order to access the fee invoice. See Questions 26 and 27 for different ways to get access to the plan. Once you have access, click on Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your SGS homepage, then click Sites and Plans . On the next page, open the plan by clicking the eye icon. Under the Fees section, click the eye icon next to the fee record. This will open the fee page, where you should see a button called SOAR REVENUE/RECEIPTS and another button called ESC Fee Invoice . Please note that if you're paying the fee in person, you need two copies of the invoice and one copy of the SOAR receipt for each requirement your plan has: SWMP, ESC, and/or GAR. You can also access a fee invoice through the Pay Fees button. Go to doee.dc.gov/sgs and click Pay Fees under the log in section. Enter in either the DOEE plan number or the fee ID. If the fee has been paid, you will see a button called Additional fee details (required SGS account) . Click this to open the fee page, where you should see a button called SOAR REVENUE/RECEIPTS and another button called ESC Fee Invoice . Note that in order to access the invoice and SOAR receipt this way, you need to have an SGS account and access to the plan. Changing Property Ownership in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) 33. I have sold a property for which I am listed as Site Owner in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS), or someone else within my organization is taking over responsibility for managing a property. How do I notify DOEE of the change? You can notify DOEE of changes in site ownership or management through the SGS. Log in, and then click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans , then Notify DOEE of a Change in Site Ownership or Management . You may need to scroll down a bit to some of these buttons. On the next page, click Ownership or Management has Changed next to the site that had the change and then fill out and save the next page. You will need to provide the new site owner or manager's contact information and the transfer date if a sale occurred. DOEE may reach out to you and/or the new site owner or manager within two business days to confirm the transfer and inform you of any next steps, if needed. This process is streamlined if either the current or the new site owner submits this change. Please note: engineers, architects, or other project designers cannot be listed as site owners. See Question 8 for more information. 34. I submitted a Notify DOEE of a Change in Site Ownership or Management request, but it hasn't been updated in the SGS. What do I do next? Submitting this notification will not automatically update the site. DOEE needs to manually make the change before you will see the change in the SGS. DOEE may reach out to you for clarification or confirmation if necessary.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"SWDC2/User-Guides/SGS-FAQ/SGS_FAQ_2022/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Updated September 16, 2022 DOEE offers regular trainings on how to use the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS).

Can I share a Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) account with my employees, co-workers, clients or a project team? No, each person using the SGS must have an account registered under their own name, and can only use that account to access the SGS. This is because the SGS is used to electronically sign legally binding agreements. If you share your account with others or use an account registered in someone else's name DOEE may disable that account or take further action. 25. Multiple people need to view or work on a project that I've entered into the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). How can I give them access? DOEE policy requires each person accessing the SGS to do so using an account registered in their own name. However, most projects require multiple people to be able to access the plans. There are two ways to grant shared access to a plan. For people in different organizations, such as the site owner and engineers working on the project, an agent relationship can be created. The site owner determines the amount of access for each agent. To create this relationship, see Question 26. For people within the same organization, the person managing an organization account can add staff. These staff will have access to everything that the organization account manager has access to. To add staff, see Question 27. 26. How do I create an agent relationship? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System(SGS) and click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your homepage, then click Agents and Staff . If you are anyone other than the site owner, click I am an agent for someone and enter in the site owner's information and click Submit . Once the site owner confirms, the agent relationship has been made. If you are the site owner, click Add an agent and enter in their information and click Submit . Once the agent confirms, the agent relationship has been made. The site owner can grant different levels of access and permission, including to all the sites they own or just to specific ones. These permissions can include Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) tasks as well. An agent can also grant access and permission to a subagent. The subagent relationship is specific to one site, so you must create a new relationship for each site. 27. How do I give staff on my team access to plan or site information? If you haven't already, you'll first need to identify a team member who will manage an organization account on behalf of your organization. If you already have an account that you'd like to make an organization account, please email Brandon Hunt at brandon.hunt@dc.gov . Otherwise, create an account and select Yes in the dropdown under Create an Organization Account . Once this is set up, the organization account manager can add staff by logging in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). On the SGS homepage, click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your homepage, then Agents and Staff and then Add my organization's staff . Fill out the subsequent page. Each user added as a staff member will have access to every site listed under the organization account.","title":"Getting and Sharing Access to a Site/Plan"},{"location":"SWDC2/User-Guides/SGS-FAQ/SGS_FAQ_2022/#certified-landscape-expert-process","text":"28.

If you have not already initiated a permit application at DCRA, please contact Julienne Bautista at julienne.bautista@dc.gov to assign the project to a reviewer. Public-right-of-way ESC projects still need to apply for a DCRA permit. 31. How do I pay my fees? How to pay your fees online When a fee is assessed, the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) will send an email notification to the person identified as the site owner and the person who submitted the plan. This notification will include a link that you can use to view any fees associated with that plan and pay them through the online payment platform. This platform accepts both Visa and MasterCard. The system may time out after 1 minute. You can also look up fees for any plan using the DOEE plan number or fee ID number (available in the fee invoice). To do this, go to doee.dc.gov/sgs and click on the blue Pay Fees button on the login page (if you are not logged in or do not have an SGS account) or on your SGS home page (if you are logged into your account). Enter either the DOEE plan number or fee ID and click Display Report . If the fee still needs to be paid, there will be a blue button called Pay Fee. Click it to begin the payment process. Note that you do not need to log into your SGS account to pay the fees, but you will need to log into view fee assessment details or download a PDF invoice. To download a PDF invoice, see Question 32. You can find these instructions online, along with more fee information, here . How to pay your fees in person You can also pay fees in person at 1101 4 th Street SW Washington, DC 20024. You will need two copies of the invoice and a copy of the SOAR revenue/receipts for each requirement your plan has: SWMP, ESC, and/or GAR. For example, an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan will need two copies of the invoice and one copy of the SOAR receipt for their ESC fees. A Stormwater Management and ESC plan will need two copies of the invoice and one SOAR receipt for the Stormwater Management fees, and two copies of the invoice and one SOAR receipt for the ESC fees, etc. If you don't have these documents with you, you won't be able to pay the fee. See Question 32 for how to access your fee invoice. Once your fee has been paid, log into the SGS and upload a copy of the receipt to the plan. See Question 4 for more information. You can find these instructions online, along with more fee information, [here][33]. 32. How do I find the invoice and SOAR receipt for a fee? You will need access to the plan in order to access the fee invoice. See Questions 26 and 27 for different ways to get access to the plan. Once you have access, click on Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your SGS homepage, then click Sites and Plans . On the next page, open the plan by clicking the eye icon.

Before you begin entering a plan please review the instruction manuals, which you can find at doee.dc.gov/sgs under the Instructions tab. If you are submitting an Erosion and Sediment Control and/or Green Area Ratio plan, but not a Stormwater Management Plan, select Permitting instructions for small projects . For Stormwater Management Plans, select Complete Instruction Manual . You can also attend an online training . If you still have questions after reading both this document and the instructions, please reach out to sgs.help@dc.gov . Why can't I see the site for my new plan in my list of sites? If you don't see the site in your list, then you need to either create it or get access to it. Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then click Sites and Plans and then New Site . Enter in the site address and click Populate data from address , fill out some of your project information, and click Save & close . If DOEE already has records identifying a site owner or manager at your address, this person will need to authorize you to act as their agent. You will see a button that says Request access to this site . Click this button to request to be an agent of the site owner. You can also follow the instructions in Question 20 to make this request. This step needs to be completed before you will be able to access the site. If there is no site owner currently listed, clicking Request access to this site will automatically give you access to the site. If you do not see the Request access to this site button, then you can continue to create the site. How do I save the information I've entered for my plan? The page you see after clicking Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans , and then New Site collects basic information about your project in order to estimate review fees and permitting requirements. Filling this page out by itself is not a plan submission. After filling this page out, you will be taken to a page that will summarize your permitting requirements and provide instructions for creating or requesting access to your project address so you can begin entering the plan. See Accessing Sites and Plans more information on how to request and share site access. Where do I go to upload my plan set/drawings/other documents? To upload documents to an existing plan, find the plan under Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain on your homepage, then Sites and Plans . Click on the eye icon to open the plan. On the plan page, there will be a section called Plan Documents with a button called Add Document . If a plan has not been entered yet, please see Question 1. This applies for raze permits as well. How do I upload my plan set documents to my plan? Depending on your internet connection and the file size, the upload may time out and give you an error. Typically, files over 100 MB will result in this error. If you receive this error, separate your file into smaller parts and upload them as \"1 of 3, 2 of 3\" etc. For plan sets, include the cover page as the first page of each part. If a plan has not been entered yet, please see Question 1. This applies for raze permits as well. Who should be listed as the site owner? The site owner should be the person who has long-term management and maintenance responsibility for the site once the project completes construction. This is the person DOEE will contact years after project completion about maintenance inspections or if there is any issue with maintenance. An engineer, architect, general contractor, or construction manager should not list themself as the site owner unless they are responsible for managing the project after completion. If they list themselves as the site owner, DOEE will require that the correct person be listed. If the site is going to be sold soon after construction completion, the current site owner still needs to be listed. The current site owner is required to sign the maintenance responsibility statement, declaration of covenant, and other documents during the plan submittal process. I'm an engineer entering a Stormwater Management Plan. How do I get my client listed as the site owner? When you submit a request to create an agent relationship, the site owner receives a request to approve the agent relationship and to confirm site ownership. Once site ownership is confirmed, the site owner will be recorded in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). For the steps to create an agent relationship, see Question 20. DOEE recommends not waiting until the last minute to get the site owner listed. Stormwater Management plans cannot be submitted, for the first time or for a resubmission, without having the site owner listed. How do I check on my plan status? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain , then Sites and Plans . On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number to open the plan. Scroll down to the Plan Review section. The bottom-most line will show the most recent plan status. Editing Plans How do I edit an approved plan? The plan reviewer needs to return the plan before you will be able to edit it. Why can't I edit my best management practice (BMP)? Once your project begins construction and DOEE has inspected your BMP, it will be locked from editing in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Please email your BMP changes to your plan reviewer so they can update it on your behalf in the SGS. For each BMP that needs to be edited, specify each value that needs to be updated (including pre- and post-project land cover values, storage volume, etc.), and also specify the existing values. Please note that any Site Drainage Areas can still be edited without DOEE's assistance. If any BMP type has changed, for example a bioretention was changed to a tree planting, DOEE will remove the old BMP but you will need to enter in the new BMP. DOEE must be notified of this change in order for it to occur. Erosion and Sediment Control Plans How do I access a site record to upload my Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) plan? If there's no site owner listed and there are only ESC plans at the site, see Question 5. If you are still unable to get access to the site, email Regan Wilhelm at regan.wilhelm@dc.gov to request access. If there is a site owner listed for the site or the site has Stormwater Management Plans associated with it, see Question 20. I'm entering an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan. What should I enter in the land cover section? For ESC only plans, the land cover types and square footages should be entered in the section called Land Cover . There are three types: natural, which is forest or meadow; compacted, which is grass and landscaped areas; and impervious, which is driveways, roofs, patios, etc. Do not just enter the total square footage of your project as natural; you'll need to enter the correct values into each section. The total pre project area and total post project area need to be equal before you will be able to save your changes. Do not include any building renovation square footage in the Impervious field. Enter that in the Building footprint field in the Project Description section. Why am I getting a Major Substantial Improvement/Major Land Disturbing error when I try to submit? I'm entering an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan. Check your land cover values that are in the plan. In the Land Cover section you should only enter the number of square feet that are being disturbed, not the total lot area. If you've entered a square footage value into the Building footprint field in the Project Description section, do not also add that value in the Impervious field in the Land Cover section. The system will double count the value and increase the total area of your project. If this crosses a certain threshold, the system will flag the plan as needing a Stormwater Management Plan. If you're doing utility work, make sure you fill in the field Portion of land disturbance that is solely utility work (square feet) in the Land Cover section. I submitted my Erosion and Sediment Control plan more than 30 business days ago and still have not received any comments. When will I hear back? Make sure your project has been submitted to DCRA through ProjectDox. DOEE review only begins after this has been completed. If you have questions relating to your ProjectDox status, please reach out to Nykia Barnes at nykia.barnes@dc.gov or Saba Gharavi at saba.gharavi@dc.gov Maintenance Responsibility and Off-Site Compliance Who should sign the Maintenance Responsibility and Off-Site Retention Volume Statements for Stormwater Management Plans? The maintenance responsibility statement and the Off-Site Retention Volume statement (if applicable) should be signed by the person listed as \"site owner or manager\" for the site in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). In most cases this should be the property owner, although it is acceptable to list a long-term property manager. The person who signs these statements becomes legally responsible for ensuring maintenance and off-site retention volume compliance once the project completes construction. These statements cannot be signed by the engineer, architect, construction manager, contractor, or landscaping company that has been hired to perform maintenance. How do I sign the Maintenance Responsibility Statement for my Stormwater Management Plan? Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS).

This may represent the SWMP, ESC plan, GAR plan, and FPM plan all under a single plan number. Do not submit plan information separately in the Surface and Groundwater System as this will delay DOEE's review process If a project is occurring over multiple distinct phases with different construction timetables, you may submit a separate plan for each phase. Applications must be made by the project engineer or designer Due to the detailed information that must be entered for each project, DOEE requires that the SGS entry is made by the project engineer or designer If the entry is made by someone unfamiliar with either DOEE's review process or the project design, this will cause substantial delays due to inaccurate entries. Especially for SWMPs, the information that must be entered is highly technical. SWMPs include detailed information about green infrastructure practices that reduce stormwater runoff. Coordinate with the Site Owner/Manager (SWMPs only) For SWMPs, DOEE requires that the site owner/manager have a Surface and Groundwater System account. The individual (such as the project engineer) who submits information on the site owner's behalf must request to be an Agent for the site owner/manager. Refer to Create and Manage An Account for more information about Agents. Pay filing fees promptly DOEE will not review SWMPs that have not paid filing fees (typically, non-SWMPs may pay all fees at the end of DOEE's review).

The Registry is comprised of several reports: SRCs for Sale : Publicly-listed SRCs; includes seller contact information, watershed where the SRCs are generated, asking price per SRC, and quantity of SRCs for sale. If you need to purchase SRCs, you may contact the sellers on this list to negotiate a trade. The price listed on this list is provided by the seller, but you may negotiate for a different price. Final SRC Sales Prices : Shows information on final SRC trades, including the watershed where the SRCs were generated, the quantity sold, and the price per SRC; if an SRC is sold multiple times, each sale will be listed separately. Expected SRCs : This report shows potential SRCs based on approved SWMPs. After certification, the SRCs may be listed in the SRCs for Sale report if the owner applies for SRC certification and chooses to list them in the registry. Expected Offv: This report lists sites that have an Offv obligation on their approved Stormwater Management Plans. Offv is an annual obligation that must be met with SRCs or payment of in- lieu fee. Sites must meet their Offv upon final inspection. The completion status of each project is indicated in this report. For projects that have completed construction, the next date SRCs or ILF will be required is listed. For projects that are under construction, the expected completion date is listed. Interested Buyers List : This report lists people who want to buy SRCs; you may list yourself as an interested buyer by logging in to the database, going to the SRC and Offv Registry, and clicking I want to buy SRCs. This report is only shown when interested buyers opt onto the list. Interested Participants: This section of the SRC and Offv Registry contains contact information for property owners, SRC-aggregating businesses, engineers, and investors who are interested in SRC-generating projects. You can use these lists to start planning an SRC-generating project or add your contact information. My SRCs and Offv From the home screen, click My SRCs and Offv to manage your participation in the SRC trading program. You can view the SRCs that you own, as well as those that you have transferred, used, and retired. You may list or remove your SRCs from the SRC Registry or change the asking price by clicking on the range and then clicking Edit. You may also access a list of SRC and Offv applications that you have submitted and DOEE's approval determination or these applications. This section of the Surface and Groundwater System includes forms and applications to: Certify SRCs Use SRCs Transfer SRCs Retire SRCs Notify DOEE of ILF payment Participate in the SRC Price Lock Program Participate in the SRC Aggregator Startup Grant Program Participate in the SRC Site Evaluation Program Off-Site Retention Volume (Offv) Offv is an annual commitment that may be met through the use of SRCs, payment of the In-Lieu Fee (ILF), or a combination of SRC use and ILF payment. One SRC satisfies one gallon of Offv for one year. One gallon of ILF payment also satisfies one gallon of Offv for one year. If an Anacostia Waterfront Development Zone (AWDZ) site uses SRCs that are generated outside the Anacostia watershed, 1.25 SRCs must be used for each gallon of Offv. This requirement will be automatically calculated. The Plans form identifies the Offv requirement and whether the site is an AWDZ site. Offv must be met annually beginning with the date of the Final Construction Inspection. Regulated sites are responsible for their Offv on an ongoing basis. Site owners or managers can apply for SRC use or pay ILF to meet the Offv requirement for several years at a time. If DOEE does not receive an application to use SRCs or an ILF payment and a lapse in Offv compliance occurs, DOEE will automatically charge the ILF with a 10 percent late fee. If in the future a regulated site increases its on-site retention, Offv can be reduced. A report called SRCs for Sale is available in the SRC Registry, as is a list of expected SRCs (the SRC eligibility for SWMPs that have been approved by DOEE but have not yet had a Final Construction Inspection). Certify SRCs On the Surface and Groundwater System home screen, click My SRCs and Offv and then click Certify SRCS. Select the SWMP number for the site that will be generating SRCs. Identify the period for which SRCs are requested (one year, two years, or three years), the asking price, and if the SRCs should be listed for sale in the SRC Registry. Select the Proposed SRC Owner. If DOEE approves the application, the Proposed SRC Owner will become the original owner of the SRCs, will be responsible for BMP maintenance, and will be able to transfer, use, or retire the SRCs. You may also identify the owner of the retention capacity or an agent for the Proposed SRC Owner. Click Save. Click Select BMPs to generate SRCs to see a list of BMPs that are able to generate SRCs. You must identify how many SRCs should be certified by each BMP. For example, if you have a SWRv requirement of 1,200 gallons, and you have two BMPs providing 1,000 gallons of retention volume and 700 gallons of retention volume, your SRC eligibility may be 500 gallons. You will need to inform DOEE how many of the 500 SRCs will be generated by each BMP. For a BMP that will generate SRCs, click Use this BMP to certify SRCs and enter the number of SRCs the BMP should generate. This will be capped at the maximum SRC eligibility for the SWMP and SDA (if applicable). Click Save to return to the application. If additional BMPs should generate SRCs, repeat steps 4 and 5. If you want to change the number of SRCs a BMP should generate, click Edit at the top of the application and overwrite the values in the embedded report. Ensure that the Unallocated SRC Eligibility column displays +/-0 on each line to ensure you are receiving the maximum number of SRCs for your project. Attach a maintenance contract for the period for which you are requesting SRC certification. For example, if you submit an SRC certification application on 6/1/2017 and you want to receive the maximum 3 years' worth of SRCs, your maintenance contract should last through 5/31/2020. The maintenance contract must last at least 1 year from the date the application is submitted in order to receive SRC certification. The proposed SRC owner must click Sign and Submit application.

Use your own account To use SGS to apply to Certify SRCs, you need to have your own SGS account. DO NOT share a username or password for an SGS account with someone else. This is against DOEE policy and may lead to deactivating the shared account. It may also delay your application and require you to re-submit. If you don't have an SGS account, create one at doee.dc.gov/sgs . 2. Confirm your site access and SRC permissions To submit a Certify SRCs application, you need to be set up in the SGS as either the site owner or their agent. 3.-Learn-how-to-find-your-site,-plan,-and-BMP-records - Site owner - If your SGS account is listed as the site owner, then you already have SRC permissions and full access to the site and can skip to Step 3 . If you are not sure, find out How to see the sites you own in the SGS Agent of the Site owner with site and SRC permissions - If you are applying on behalf of the site owner, you first need to be set up in the SGS as the site owner's agent. Follow the Agents & Staff Instructions and make sure the site owner provides you with SRC permissions. If you can't see the plan in the SGS after following the Instructions to locate a plan , then you need to set up the correct agent relationship that specifies SRC permissions for that site. 3. Learn how to find your site, plan, and BMP records Before you can apply to Certify SRCs, you must already have a DOEE-approved Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) in the SGS. To complete this application, you also need to know how to open your SWMP and best management practice (BMP) records to view or add information. How to open a site or plan record in the SGS Log in to the SGS and click the Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain button. Click the Sites and Plans button. In the My Sites section or the All Plans section, look for the address or plan number to locate the correct record. Click the \"eye\" icon next to the record to open it.

Scroll down to the BMPs section to see a report of the BMP records, including the type and ID number for each one. Click the \"eye\" icon next to a record to see more detail. 4. Get your as-built approved You are required to have a DOEE-approved as-built Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) in the SGS before you can complete an application to Certify SRCs. To be able to submit the as-built plan for approval, you must first have an approved SWMP with an approved DOEE final construction inspection in the SGS. If you know the as-built is already uploaded and approved in the SGS, skip to Step 5 . How to see if the as-built has been uploaded and approved Open the plan record in the SGS ( click here to learn how . Scroll down to the Plan Documents section and look for entry near the bottom of the list where the column: File Type -- says \"As-built\" File -- includes the word \"stamped\" in the file name, which means it is approved. If you've found a stamped as-built, skip to [Step 5][6]. If not, you need to [submit the as-built][23]. How to submit the as-built Open the plan record in the SGS ([click here to learn how][20]). Scroll down to the Plan Documents section and click the Submit as-built button (see screenshot on the next page). If you don't see the Submit as-built button, check with your: DOEE plan reviewer to make sure the plan has been approved in the SGS.

In the Type of Document field, select as-built , and then click Save & close . Your DOEE inspector will review the as-built for approval and may contact you if there are questions. 5. Get your BMP inspections approved To apply to Certify SRCs, all stormwater BMPs that are part of the plan must have passed an inspection within the prior six months that is recorded in the SGS. Is this the first time you are certifying SRCs for this plan? If you completed a DOEE final construction inspection or a DOEE maintenance inspection within the past 6 months, you have met this requirement and can skip to Step 6 . If not, you need to contact your DOEE inspector to schedule a new on-site inspection. Have you certified SRCs for this plan before and are applying to re-certify? You may have the option to conduct your own BMP inspection(s) and ask DOEE to approve them through the Self-Inspection Self-Reporting (SISR) process in the SGS. Learn more about SISR . How to see if a recent inspection is recorded in the SGS Open the plan record in the SGS ( click here to learn how ). Scroll down to the Inspections section and look for the most recent inspection date. It could be under Construction Inspections or Maintenance Inspections . If this project is certifying SRCs for first time and the most recent DOEE inspection was more than 6 months ago, you will need to contact your DOEE inspector to schedule an on-site inspection. If this project is re-certifying SRCs and the most recent inspection was more than 6 months ago, you need to complete SISR. 6. Prepare your Maintenance Agreement You must attach a maintenance agreement that covers the same period as your application to Certify SRCs. See the Certify SRCs -- Maintenance Agreement Guide for instructions. 7. Set a value for your SRCs (optional) If you don't plan to sell SRCs in the SRC Registry you can skip this step.
