# Create and Manage An Account
In order to submit projects that require Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control (ESC) and/or Green Area Ratio (GAR) review, you must have an
account to use the Surface and Groundwater System. All Surface and
Groundwater System users must have their own accounts, and can use a
single account to submit multiple projects.

## Request an Account

1.  The database is available at
[doee.dc.gov/SGS](http://doee.dc.gov/sgs).

2.  Click the link to register for a new account. Complete the form
with your own contact information. Do not enter the contact
information for a client or the address of the project you are
submitting.

3.  Complete the form and click *Submit* to request your account.

4.  Within the next business day, the Department of Energy &
  Environment (DOEE) will grant you access to the database and
notify you via email with log in instructions. This email and
many other notifications will be sent to you from
[notify@quickbase.com](mailto:notify@quickbase.com).
The subject line for this email will be *QuickBase invite to the
"Surface and Groundwater System" app.* Please confirm that it
did not get moved to your spam/junk folder by mistake.

5.  After you receive an email from DOEE with login instructions,
follow the instructions in the email to create your password.
Your username will always be your email address. Periodically,
your password will expire. You can request a new password from
the login screen.

6.  To access the Surface and Groundwater System, go to the login
page [http://doee.dc.gov/sgs](http://doee.dc.gov/swdb), and log in with your email address and password.


## Update your Contact Info

When you request an account, the contact information you enter is saved
in the database. This information will be used to pre-fill forms and
applications you submit within the database and will be used by DOEE as your primary contact information. If you need to update
your contact information, log in to the Surface and Groundwater System,
go to the *Support* menu, and click *Edit Account Information.* This
will not change your username or password.

## Change Site Ownership or Management

If you own or manage a site, and there is a change in site ownership or
management, you must notify DOEE of this change.

1.  From the database home screen, click *Sites and Plans.*

2.  Click *Notify DOEE of a Change in Site Ownership or Management.*

3.  A report will display all of the sites you own or manage. On the
     record for the site, click *Notify DOEE of a change in site
     ownership or management.*

4.  Enter information for the new site owner and the date of settlement.
    Save the form to submit it to DOEE. DOEE will record the transfer of
    site ownership, and you will no longer be listed as the site owner or
    manager.
