can be used to electronically sign and submit documents that carry legal
obligations.

## Device

Most uses of the Surface and Groundwater System require a desktop
computer or laptop. A streamlined version of the SGS will display, on
mobile devices and tablets, but it will not include the full functions
of the desktop version. If a mobile device or tablet is used to access
the SGS, DOEE recommends configuring the device to display the full
version of the SGS rather than the mobile version.

## Browser

The Surface and Groundwater System functions best on Google Chrome. Use
of Internet Explorer is discouraged, as many Surface and Groundwater
System functions will not work properly on Internet Explorer.
