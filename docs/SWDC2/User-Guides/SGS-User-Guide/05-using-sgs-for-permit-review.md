# Using the Surface and Groundwater System during Permit Review

During the permitting process, you must submit compliance information in
the Surface and Groundwater System to support DOEE review for:
  
  -   Stormwater Management Plans (SWMPs)

-   Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Plans

-   Green Area Ratio (GAR) Plans

-   Floodplain Management (FPM) Plans

## Recommendations to Avoid Permitting Delays

#### Submit one plan per project

Only submit one plan in the Surface and Groundwater System for the
project. This may represent the SWMP, ESC plan, GAR plan, and FPM plan
all under a single plan number. Do not submit plan information
separately in the Surface and Groundwater System as this will delay
DOEE's review process

If a project is occurring over multiple distinct phases with different
construction timetables, you may submit a separate plan for each phase.

#### Applications must be made by the project engineer or designer

Due to the detailed information that must be entered for each project,
DOEE requires that the SGS entry is made by the project engineer or
designer If the entry is made by someone unfamiliar with either DOEE's
review process or the project design, this will cause substantial delays
due to inaccurate entries. Especially for SWMPs, the information that
must be entered is highly technical. SWMPs include detailed information
about green infrastructure practices that reduce stormwater runoff.

#### Coordinate with the Site Owner/Manager (SWMPs only)

For SWMPs, DOEE requires that the site owner/manager have a Surface and
Groundwater System account. The individual (such as the project
                                            engineer) who submits information on the site owner's behalf must
request to be an *Agent* for the site owner/manager. Refer to [Create and Manage An Account](03-create-manage-account.md)
for more information about *Agents.*

#### Pay filing fees promptly

DOEE will not review SWMPs that have not paid filing fees (typically,
non-SWMPs may pay all fees at the end of DOEE's review). If you do not
pay filing fees, review of your plan will be placed "On hold" and you
will be notified via email.

#### Upload all relevant documents

Many documents are useful for DOEE's review, such as reports, meeting
minutes, certifications, etc. You

may attach these to the plan information in order to keep them easily
available to DOEE's reviewer.

#### Do not enter "placeholder" or false information

If you are completing a form in the database and do not know the
information requested, leave the

answer blank. Do not enter "placeholder" information like "TBD."

Entry of false information will cause confusion during the permitting
process and result in delays as DOEE attempts to determine the correct
information. The District's stormwater management regulations also
prohibit you from negligently, recklessly, or knowingly making a false
statement in a communication with DOEE.

## Enter a new Site

The first step to submit a project to DOEE for review is to enter
information about where the site is located. If there is more than one
project occurring at a site, you only need to enter the site information
once, as it can be used for all projects as necessary.

1.  Click Sites and Plans and then click *New Site.*

2.  A form will appear to collect preliminary project information (this
    may also be referred to as the "plan estimation form"). This helps
    to determine what information you will need to provide later.
    Complete the form and click *Save.* After saving the form, review
    the estimated requirements for your project. Depending on the
    information you enter, you will need to refer to different sections
    of these instructions after you complete your Site information:**.**

    -   **If your project requires a Stormwater Management Plan
         (SWMP):** Complete the below steps and then proceed to
          [Submit a Stormwater Management Plan](../Plans/Stormwater-Management-Plans/07-submit-a-stormwater-management-plan.md)

    -   **If your project does not require a SWMP:** Complete the below
         steps and then proceed to [Submit a Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan or Green Area Ratio Plan](../Plans/Erosion-Sediment-Control-Plans/06-submit-a-soil-erosion-and-sediment-control-plan.md)

3.  If DOEE already has records for this address in the Surface and
    Groundwater System, click *Request Access to this Site* to open the
    existing records and begin entering the project*.* If the owner or
    manager of the site already has a Surface and Groundwater System
    account, you will need to wait for their approval to access their
    site. Then, proceed to Section
    [VIII](#submit-a-stormwater-management-plan) or Section
    [VII](#submit-a-soil-erosion-and-sediment-control-plan-or-green-area-ratio-plan)
    of the instructions, as indicated in step 2 of this section,
    skipping the remaining steps in this section.

4.  If DOEE does not already have records for this address in the
     Surface and Groundwater System, click *Begin entering this
     project.*

5.  If entering a new site follow the steps displayed on the form in the
    Surface and Groundwater System. Then, proceed to either [Section
    [VII](#submit-a-soil-erosion-and-sediment-control-plan-or-green-area-ratio-plan)
    or Section]{.underline}
    [[VIII]{.underline}](#submit-a-stormwater-management-plan) of the
    instructions as indicated in step 2 of this section.

-   For sites with SWMPs, you must select the *Site owner/manager*.
The site owner is responsible for complying with the terms of
plans approved by DOEE including maintenance of land cover,
BMPs, and any off-site retention volume (Offv). The site owner
listed in the database should be the person who owns the site
or an agent of the site owner who will be responsible for
long-term management of the site. Typically, the project
engineer for a project would not be a long-term agent of the
site and should not be listed here. If the site owner or
manager is a client of yours, please set up an agent
relationship in order to submit a plan for this site on your
client's behalf. Refer to [Create and Manage An Account](03-create-manage-account.md) for instructions to
act on the behalf of others.
