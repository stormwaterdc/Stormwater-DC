# Apply for RiverSmart Rewards

You can apply for RiverSmart Rewards to receive discounts on your DC
Water bill with the Surface and Groundwater System. Discounts are
calculated based on the installation of green infrastructure practices
that retain stormwater. These are also called stormwater retention Best
Management Practices, or BMPs. If your BMPs were installed through
DOEE's RiverSmart Homes program, you may have signed up to be
automatically enrolled in RiverSmart Rewards. This has been offered as
an option to RiverSmart Homes participants who have signed up since
summer 2015. If you are not sure whether you are signed up to be
automatically enrolled in RiverSmart Rewards, contact DOEE at
[riversmart.rewards@dc.gov](mailto:riversmart.rewards@dc.gov)
or (202) 535-2679.
