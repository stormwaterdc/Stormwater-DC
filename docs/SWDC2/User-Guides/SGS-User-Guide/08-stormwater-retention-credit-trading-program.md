# Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) Trading and Offv

## View the SRC and Offv Registry

From the home screen, click *SRC and Offv Registry* to view the SRC
Registry. The Registry is comprised of several reports:
  
  -   **SRCs for Sale***:* Publicly-listed SRCs; includes seller contact
information, watershed where the SRCs are generated, asking price
per SRC, and quantity of SRCs for sale. If you need to purchase
SRCs, you may contact the sellers on this list to negotiate a trade.
The price listed on this list is provided by the seller, but you may
negotiate for a different price.

-   **Final SRC Sales Prices***:* Shows information on final SRC trades,
including the watershed where the SRCs were generated, the quantity
sold, and the price per SRC; if an SRC is sold multiple times, each
sale will be listed separately.

-   **Expected SRCs***:* This report shows potential SRCs based on
approved SWMPs. After certification, the SRCs may be listed in the
*SRCs for Sale* report if the owner applies for SRC certification
and chooses to list them in the registry.

-   **Expected Offv:** This report lists sites that have an Offv
obligation on their approved Stormwater Management Plans. Offv is an
annual obligation that must be met with SRCs or payment of in- lieu
fee. Sites must meet their Offv upon final inspection. The
completion status of each project is indicated in this report. For
projects that have completed construction, the next date SRCs or ILF
will be required is listed. For projects that are under
construction, the expected completion date is listed.

-   **Interested Buyers List***:* This report lists people who want to
buy SRCs; you may list yourself as an interested buyer by logging in
to the database, going to the SRC and Offv Registry, and clicking *I
want to buy SRCs.* This report is only shown when interested buyers
opt onto the list.

-   **Interested Participants:** This section of the SRC and Offv
Registry contains contact information for property owners,
SRC-aggregating businesses, engineers, and investors who are
interested in SRC-generating projects. You can use these lists to
start planning an SRC-generating project or add your contact
information.

## My SRCs and Offv

From the home screen, click *My SRCs and Offv* to manage your
participation in the SRC trading program. You can view the SRCs that you
own, as well as those that you have transferred, used, and retired. You
may list or remove your SRCs from the SRC Registry or change the asking
price by clicking on the range and then clicking *Edit.* You may also
access a list of SRC and Offv applications that you have submitted and
DOEE's approval determination or these applications.

This section of the Surface and Groundwater System includes forms and
applications to:

-   Certify SRCs

-   Use SRCs

-   Transfer SRCs

-   Retire SRCs

-   Notify DOEE of ILF payment

-   Participate in the SRC Price Lock Program

-   Participate in the SRC Aggregator Startup Grant Program

-   Participate in the SRC Site Evaluation Program

## Off-Site Retention Volume (Offv)

Offv is an annual commitment that may be met through the use of SRCs,
payment of the In-Lieu Fee (ILF), or a combination of SRC use and ILF
payment. One SRC satisfies one gallon of Offv for one year. One gallon
of ILF payment also satisfies one gallon of Offv for one year. If an
Anacostia Waterfront Development Zone (AWDZ) site uses SRCs that are
generated outside the Anacostia watershed, 1.25 SRCs must be used for
each gallon of Offv. This requirement will be automatically calculated.
The *Plans* form identifies the Offv requirement and whether the site is
an AWDZ site.

Offv must be met annually beginning with the date of the Final
Construction Inspection. Regulated sites are responsible for their Offv
on an ongoing basis. Site owners or managers can apply for SRC use or
pay ILF to meet the Offv requirement for several years at a time. If
DOEE does not receive an application to use SRCs or an ILF payment and a
lapse in Offv compliance occurs, DOEE will automatically charge the ILF
with a 10 percent late fee. If in the future a regulated site increases
its on-site retention, Offv can be reduced.

A report called *SRCs for Sale* is available in the SRC Registry, as is
a list of expected SRCs (the SRC eligibility for SWMPs that have been
approved by DOEE but have not yet had a Final Construction Inspection).

## Certify SRCs

1.  On the Surface and Groundwater System home screen, click *My SRCs
    and Offv* and then click

 *Certify SRCS.*

2.  Select the SWMP number for the site that will be generating SRCs.
    Identify the period for which SRCs are requested (one year, two
    years, or three years), the asking price, and if the SRCs should be
    listed for sale in the SRC Registry.

3.  Select the Proposed SRC Owner. If DOEE approves the application, the
    Proposed SRC Owner will become the original owner of the SRCs, will
    be responsible for BMP maintenance, and will be

able to transfer, use, or retire the SRCs. You may also identify the
owner of the retention capacity or an agent for the Proposed SRC Owner.
Click *Save.*

4.  Click *Select BMPs to generate SRCs* to see a list of BMPs that are
    able to generate SRCs. You must identify how many SRCs should be
    certified by each BMP. For example, if you have a SWRv requirement
    of 1,200 gallons, and you have two BMPs providing 1,000 gallons of
    retention volume and 700 gallons of retention volume, your SRC
    eligibility may be 500 gallons. You will need to inform DOEE how
    many of the 500 SRCs will be generated by each BMP.

5.  For a BMP that will generate SRCs, click *Use this BMP to certify
    SRCs* and enter the number of SRCs the BMP should generate. This
    will be capped at the maximum SRC eligibility for the SWMP and SDA
    (if applicable). Click *Save* to return to the application.

6.  If additional BMPs should generate SRCs, repeat steps 4 and 5. If
    you want to change the number of SRCs a BMP should generate, click
    *Edit* at the top of the application and overwrite the values in the
    embedded report. Ensure that the *Unallocated SRC Eligibility*
    column displays +/-0 on each line to ensure you are receiving the
    maximum number of SRCs for your project.

7.  Attach a maintenance contract for the period for which you are
    requesting SRC certification. For example, if you submit an SRC
    certification application on 6/1/2017 and you want to receive the
    maximum 3 years' worth of SRCs, your maintenance contract should
last through 5/31/2020. The maintenance contract must last at least
1 year from the date the application is submitted in order to
receive SRC certification.

8.  The proposed SRC owner must click *Sign and Submit* application.
 Read the signature statement and enter your name in the
 *Signature* field. Click *Submit.*
  
  9.  After you submit the application, you may be prompted to apply for
RiverSmart Rewards to receive a discount on stormwater fees. If you
would like to receive the RiverSmart Rewards discount, follow
on-screen prompts to sign your RiverSmart Rewards application (the
                                                               rest of the application is automatically populated by the database).
To submit your application for RiverSmart Rewards separately from
your SRC application, please refer to [Section
                                       [V](#apply-for-riversmart-rewards): [Apply

                                             DOEE will review the application. You will be notified by email if DOEE
                                             approves, approves in part, or disapproves your application. If your
                                             application is approved, the SRCs will appear in your account and in the
                                             SRC Registry (if requested), and you will be able to use, transfer, or
                                             retire them.
