###1.  Dates that cover the entire certification period

- Site owner must maintain the BMPs that generate SRCs throughout the entire certification period. 
- Maintenance agreement must specify start and end dates that show this requirement will be met.

>ðŸ’¡ **Tip**
> 
> Have your maintenance agreement extend a few weeks after the requested SRC certification period as a buffer to allow for potential extended review time.
>
>Your certification period begins on the date DOEE receives your **complete** application that is not missing any information. See the [Certify SRCs -- SGS Application Guide](../Certify-SRCs_SGS-Application-Guide) for full instructions.

??? info "Sample date range language"

    **Example:**

    - A company wants to certify SRCs for three years: July 15, 2022, through July 14, 2025.
    - They submit their complete Certify SRCs application on July 15, 2022. 
    - DOEE approves the application on July 20, 2022. Since their application was complete when it was submitted, the SRC certification period is July 15, 2022, through July 14, 2025.

    :heavy_check_mark: These examples **do** cover the certification period:
    
    - "This agreement begins on July 15, 2022, and extends through July 30, 2025."

    - "This agreement begins on July 1, 2022, and extends through August 30, 2025."

    - "This agreement begins on the date both parties sign the document (July 10, 2022) and extends three years and two weeks thereafter." 

     :x: These examples **do not** cover the certification period:
    
    - "This agreement begins on January 1, 2022, and extends through December 31, 2024."

    - "This agreement begins on July 13, 2022, and extends through July 12, 2025."

### 2. Maintenance details for each BMP type

#### If your plan is regulated
If your Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) is for a Major Land Disturbing or Major Substantial Improvement project (which are regulated activities):

- You must maintain **all** BMPs in the SWMP to be eligible to certify SRCs, and 
- Your maintenance agreement must describe the detailed maintenance tasks that you or your contractor will perform for **all** BMP types specified in the SWMP.

#### If your plan is unregulated

If your Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) does not involve a regulated activity:

- You are only required to maintain the BMPs that certify SRCs, and
- Your maintenance agreement is only required to describe the maintenance tasks for the BMP types that will certify SRCs. This could be one, a few, or all the BMPs listed on the plan.

#### How to find the BMP types in your plan

[Learn how to find types of BMPs included in your plan.](../Certify-SRCs_SGS-Application-Guide#3-learn-how-to-find-your-site-plan-and-bmp-records)

#### How to find the required maintenance tasks for each BMP type

Please see Chapter 3 of DOEE's Stormwater Management Guidebook which has detailed descriptions of the required maintenance tasks for each BMP type.

### 3. Summary of the maintenance provider's experience/expertise

You must provide a brief description to explain how the person or company who will maintain the specific BMPs in your plan is qualified to do this type of work.

These are examples of acceptable justifications:

-   Job description of the person who will perform the maintenance tasks, including specific experience maintaining green infrastructure

-   National Green Infrastructure Certification Program certification

-   Other green infrastructure maintenance certifications

-   Photos of other green infrastructure BMPs this provider has maintained

-   DOEE plan numbers where this provider conducted green infrastructure maintenance that passed DOEE inspection

### 4. Statement of understanding

Include the following text:

>[Site owner/Company Name] understands and acknowledges that DOEE may 
require Stormwater Retention Credits to be retired if a BMP on the application
fails a DOEE maintenance inspection.


### 5. Signatures and dates

#### For in-house maintenance

If a person in the site owner's company/organization will perform the BMP maintenance tasks, you are only required to have one official from the site owner's company sign/date your maintenance agreement.

#### For third-party maintenance providers

If a third-party contractor will perform the maintenance tasks, both the site owner (or an official in their company/organization) and the third-party contractor must sign/date the maintenance contract.
