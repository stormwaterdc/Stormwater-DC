## Entering Plans

### How do I reset my password?

To reset your password, go to [doee.dc.gov/sgs](doee.dc.gov/sgs). 
Under the password field, click the link I forgot my password. 
Enter the email address that your account is under and click Submit. 
You should soon receive an email to reset your password; follow the instructions from there.

If you donâ€™t receive an email, please check your spam folder. 


### How do I enter and submit a new plan?

Before you begin entering a plan please review the instruction manuals,
which you can find at [doee.dc.gov/sgs](https://octo.quickbase.com/up/bjezqjzuy/g/rbe/eg/va/Log_In.html)
under the ***Instructions*** tab. If you are submitting an Erosion and
Sediment Control and/or Green Area Ratio plan, but not a Stormwater
Management Plan, select ***Permitting instructions for small
projects***. For Stormwater Management Plans, select ***Complete
Instruction Manual**.* You can also attend an [online
training](https://doee.dc.gov/swtraining). If you still
have questions after reading both this document and the instructions,
please reach out to
[sgs.help@dc.gov](sgs.help@dc.gov).

### Why can't I see the site for my new plan in my list of sites?

If you don't see the site in your list, then you need to either
create it or get access to it. Click ***Erosion, Stormwater, Green
Area Ratio and Floodplain***, then click ***Sites and Plans*** and
then ***New Site***. Enter in the site address and click ***Populate
data from address***, fill out some of your project information, and
click ***Save & close***.

If DOEE already has records identifying a site owner or manager at your
address, this person will need to authorize you to act as their agent.
You will see a button that says ***Request access to this site***. Click
this button to request to be an agent of the site owner. You can also
follow the instructions in Question 20 to make this request. This step
needs to be completed before you will be able to access the site.

If there is no site owner currently listed, clicking ***Request access
to this site*** will automatically give you access to the site.

If you do not see the ***Request access to this site*** button, then
you can continue to create the site.

### How do I save the information I've entered for my plan?

The page you see after clicking ***Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area
Ratio and Floodplain***, then ***Sites and Plans***, and then ***New
Site*** collects basic information about your project in order to
estimate review fees and permitting requirements. Filling this page
out by itself is *not* a plan submission.

After filling this page out, you will be taken to a page that will
summarize your permitting requirements and provide instructions for
creating or requesting access to your project address so you can begin
entering the plan. See [Accessing Sites and Plans](User-Guides/SGS-FAQ/Getting-and-Sharing-Access-to-a-Site-or-Plan.md) more information on how
to request and share site access.

### Where do I go to upload my plan set/drawings/other documents?

To upload documents to an existing plan, find the plan under
***Erosion, Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain*** on your
homepage, then ***Sites and Plans***. Click on the eye icon to open
the plan. On the plan page, there will be a section called ***Plan
Documents*** with a button called ***Add Document***.

If a plan has not been entered yet, please see Question 1. This applies
for raze permits as well.

### How do I upload my plan set documents to my plan?

Depending on your internet connection and the file size, the upload
may time out and give you an error. Typically, files over 100 MB will
result in this error.

If you receive this error, separate your file into smaller parts and
upload them as "1 of 3, 2 of 3" etc. For plan sets, include the cover
page as the first page of each part.

If a plan has not been entered yet, please see Question 1. This
applies for raze permits as well.

### Who should be listed as the site owner?

The site owner should be the person who has long-term management and
maintenance responsibility for the site once the project completes
construction. This is the person DOEE will

contact years after project completion about maintenance inspections or
if there is any issue with maintenance. An engineer, architect, general
contractor, or construction manager should not list themself as the site
owner unless they are responsible for managing the project after
completion. If they list themselves as the site owner, DOEE will require
that the correct person be listed.

If the site is going to be sold soon after construction completion, the
current site owner still needs to be listed. The current site owner is
required to sign the maintenance responsibility statement, declaration
of covenant, and other documents during the plan submittal process.

### I'm an engineer entering a Stormwater Management Plan. How do I get my client listed as the site owner?

When you submit a request to create an agent relationship, the site
owner receives a request to approve the agent relationship and to
confirm site ownership. Once site ownership is confirmed, the site owner
will be recorded in the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). For the
steps to create an agent relationship, see Question 20. DOEE recommends
not waiting until the last minute to get the site owner listed.
Stormwater Management plans cannot be submitted, for the first time or
for a resubmission, without having the site owner listed.

### How do I check on my plan status?

Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click ***Erosion,
Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain***, then ***Sites and
Plans***. On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number
to open the plan.

Scroll down to the ***Plan Review*** section. The bottom-most line will
show the most recent plan status.

## Editing Plans
### How do I edit an approved plan?

The plan reviewer needs to return the plan before you will be able to
edit it.

### Why can't I edit my best management practice (BMP)?

Once your project begins construction and DOEE has inspected your BMP,
it will be locked from editing in the Surface and Groundwater System
(SGS). Please email your BMP changes to your plan reviewer so they can
update it on your behalf in the SGS.

For each BMP that needs to be edited, specify each value that needs to
be updated (including pre- and post-project land cover values, storage
volume, etc.), and also specify the existing values.

Please note that any Site Drainage Areas can still be edited without
DOEE's assistance.

If any BMP type has changed, for example a bioretention was changed to
a tree planting, DOEE will remove the old BMP but you will need to
enter in the new BMP. DOEE must be notified of this change in order
for it to occur.

## Erosion and Sediment Control Plans
### How do I access a site record to upload my Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) plan?

If there's no site owner listed and there are *only* ESC plans at the
site, see Question 5. If you are still unable to get access to the site,
email Regan Wilhelm at
[regan.wilhelm@dc.gov](mailto:regan.wilhelm@dc.gov) to
request access.

If there is a site owner listed for the site or the site has
Stormwater Management Plans associated with it, see Question 20.

### I'm entering an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan. What should I enter in the land cover section?

For ESC only plans, the land cover types and square footages should be
entered in the section called ***Land Cover***. There are three types:
natural, which is forest or meadow; compacted, which is grass and
landscaped areas; and impervious, which is driveways, roofs, patios,
etc. Do not just enter the total square footage of your project as
natural; you'll need to enter the correct values into each section.

The ***total pre project area*** and ***total post project area***
need to be equal before you will be able to save your changes.

Do not include any building renovation square footage in the
***Impervious*** field. Enter that in the

***Building footprint*** field in the ***Project Description***
section.

### Why am I getting a Major Substantial Improvement/Major Land Disturbing error when I try to submit? I'm entering an Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) only plan.

Check your land cover values that are in the plan. In the ***Land
Cover*** section you should only enter the number of square feet that
are being disturbed, not the total lot area.

If you've entered a square footage value into the ***Building
footprint*** field in the ***Project Description*** section, *do not*
also add that value in the ***Impervious*** field in the ***Land
Cover*** section. The system will double count the value and increase
the total area of your project. If this crosses a certain threshold, the
system will flag the plan as needing a Stormwater Management Plan.

If you're doing utility work, make sure you fill in the field
***Portion of land disturbance that is solely utility work (square
feet)*** in the ***Land Cover*** section.

### I submitted my Erosion and Sediment Control plan more than 30 business days ago and still have not received any comments. When will I hear back?

Make sure your project has been submitted to DCRA through ProjectDox.
DOEE review only begins after this has been completed. If you have
questions relating to your ProjectDox status, please reach out to
Nykia Barnes at [nykia.barnes@dc.gov](mailto:nykia.barnes@dc.gov) or
Saba Gharavi at [saba.gharavi@dc.gov](mailto:saba.gharavi@dc.gov)

## Maintenance Responsibility and Off-Site Compliance 
### Who should sign the Maintenance Responsibility and Off-Site Retention Volume Statements for Stormwater Management Plans?

The maintenance responsibility statement and the Off-Site Retention
Volume statement (if applicable) should be signed by the person listed
as "site owner or manager" for the site in the Surface and Groundwater
System (SGS). In most cases this should be the property owner, although
it is acceptable to list a long-term property manager. The person who
signs these

statements becomes legally responsible for ensuring maintenance and
off-site retention volume compliance once the project completes
construction. These statements cannot be signed by the engineer,
architect, construction manager, contractor, or landscaping company that
has been hired to perform maintenance.

### How do I sign the Maintenance Responsibility Statement for my Stormwater Management Plan?

Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click ***Erosion,
Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain***, then ***Sites and
Plans***. On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number
to open the plan.

Scroll down to the ***BMPs*** section and click the button ***Sign
Maintenance Responsibility Stamp***. Fill out the next page and
***Save***.

### How do I sign the Offv Statement for my Stormwater Management Plan?

Log in to the Surface and Groundwater System (SGS). Click ***Erosion,
Stormwater, Green Area Ratio and Floodplain***, then ***Sites and
Plans***. On the next page, click the eye icon next to the plan number
to open the plan.

Scroll down to the ***Summary, Offv, and SRCs*** section and click the
button ***Sign Offv Statement***. Fill out the next page and
***Save***.
