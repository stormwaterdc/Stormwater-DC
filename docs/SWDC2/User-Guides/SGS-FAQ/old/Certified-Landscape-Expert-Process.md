# Certified Landscape Expert Process

## For Site Owners and Engineers
### How can I add/update certified landscape expert (CLE) information on an existing plan?

Under the CLE Information section of the plan, click the ***Add/edit CLE
information*** button. You should then be able to add/edit the CLE
information.

## For Certified Landscape Experts (CLE)
### How do I sign a Green Area Ratio (GAR) checklist?

*Please read these instructions in their entirety before completing
the GAR checklist*

1.  Before the CLE can sign the GAR Checklist statements, they must
    create a Surface and Groundwater System (SGS) account if they do
    not have one already. Go to
    [doee.dc.gov/sgs](http://doee.dc.gov/sgs) to create
    an account. The email entered in the CLE information section of
    the plan **must match the email associated with the CLE's
    account** in order for you to access the project. Creating an
    account does not automatically grant the CLE access to projects in
    the SGS (see Step 2).

2.  Before signing the checklist statement, the CLE must make sure that
    your contact information and GAR required licensing credentials
    are entered in the SGS plan under the ***CLE Information***
    section. If the CLE information is not shown in the GAR checklist
    or if it shows the wrong information, click the ***Update CLE
    information*** link in the email and enter the correct
    information. You cannot update the checklist itself. The
    information is automatically populated from the plan page in the
    SGS.

    a.  During plan entry, the project owner or their agent enters the
        CLE information by clicking the ***Add/edit CLE information***
        button on the plan form. If the construction CLE is unknown at
        the time, then the design CLE's information will
        automatically populate the construction section. An SGS error
        will appear preventing plan approval if the credentials are
        not provided.

    b.  If the project was approved prior to May 5, 2020, the CLE's
        credential information must be entered in the SGS before
        signing the GAR checklist. On the project page, click the
        ***Add/edit CLE information*** button to add the required
        information before signing the GAR Checklist.

3.  When DOEE's inspector completes the final GAR inspection, the CLE
    will receive an email requesting their signature on the landscape
    checklist. The CLE will click the link in the email and enter
    their login credentials.

4.  On the page that opens, click the ***Edit*** button at the top of
    the page, then complete all required questions on the landscape
    checklist. The SGS will automatically fill the credential
    information into the GAR Checklist. When the form is saved, the
    CLE's electronic signature will be applied.

5.  Once the CLE saves the form, the DOEE inspector can sign the
    landscape checklist. After this is done the CLE will receive a
    completed copy of the GAR Landscape Checklist via email.
