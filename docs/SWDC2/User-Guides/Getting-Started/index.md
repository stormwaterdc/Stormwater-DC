- If you changed companies, [create a new SGS account](#create-an-account) for your new email.

## Tips for your best experience with the SGS
- Use Google Chrome (some functions may not work with Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge).
- Use a desktop computer or laptop. 
- If you use a mobile device or tablet, use a browser window instead of a mobile app.
- Log out each day to avoid a session timeout error that can prevent you from logging back in.
- The tabs in the green bar at the top of each SGS page have links to find helpful information: instructions, support, contacts, and other resources.
